## About the Test

This test will help us measure your knowledge of the Laravel framework. It's nothing really complex as this is meant to be just a test but it does covers a lot of the fundamentals.

You will be building a very simple CRM application to manage companies and their employees. Said application needs to meet the following requirements:

- Ability to log-in as an administrator (email: admin@example.com, password: supersecret)
- Remove ability to register to the app.
- CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for Companies and Employees.
- The Company model should include -at least- the following fields: name, email, logo, phone, and website.
- The Employee model should include -at least- the following fields: company ID, first name, last name, position, email, and phone.
- Store company logos in */storage/app/public* and make said assets accessible from */public*.
- Use resource controllers with default methods (*index, create, store, show,* etc.)
- Validate requests via Request classes.
- Companies/Employees list must show up to 10 items per page.
- Send an email notification (either via Mailtrap or Mailgun) to the administrator whenever a new Company is registered.

Additionally, you're required to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to track the history of changes with your project.

How you tackle these tasks and the overall project is entirely up to you. Be mindful of your time management though, remember that there's a deadline for this.

Good luck!
